- [ ] API endpoints responding correctly
- [ ] Database queries working
- [ ] Logs showing no errors

### Performance
- [ ] App starts within health check timeout
- [ ] Response times acceptable
- [ ] Database queries optimized
- [ ] No memory leaks (monitor logs)

### Monitoring Setup
- [ ] Regular log checks scheduled
- [ ] Error alerting configured (optional)
- [ ] Uptime monitoring (optional)
- [ ] Cost monitoring (Fly.io dashboard)

## üîÑ Ongoing Maintenance Checklist

### Regular Tasks
- [ ] Monitor logs weekly: `flyctl logs`
- [ ] Check app status: `flyctl status`
- [ ] Review GitHub Actions runs
- [ ] Update dependencies (Dependabot PRs)
- [ ] Review security alerts

### Before Each Deployment
- [ ] Tests passing locally
- [ ] Code reviewed
- [ ] Breaking changes documented
- [ ] Database migrations ready
- [ ] Rollback plan in place

### After Each Deployment
- [ ] Verify deployment success
- [ ] Check logs for errors
- [ ] Test critical endpoints
- [ ] Monitor for issues
- [ ] Update documentation if needed

## üÜò Troubleshooting Checklist

### If Deployment Fails
- [ ] Check GitHub Actions logs
- [ ] Verify GHCR image exists
- [ ] Check Fly.io logs: `flyctl logs`
- [ ] Verify secrets are set: `flyctl secrets list`
- [ ] Check app status: `flyctl status`
- [ ] Try manual deploy: `flyctl deploy --image ghcr.io/smiileyface/flowlog-api:main`

### If App Not Responding
- [ ] Check health endpoint: `curl https://flowlog-api.fly.dev/health`
- [ ] View logs: `flyctl logs`
- [ ] Check machine status: `flyctl machines list`
- [ ] Restart app: `flyctl apps restart`
- [ ] Verify database connection
- [ ] Check resources (CPU/memory)

### If Database Issues
- [ ] Verify connection: `flyctl postgres connect -a flowlog-db`
- [ ] Check migrations: `flyctl ssh console -C "cd /app && alembic current"`
- [ ] Run migrations: `flyctl ssh console -C "cd /app && alembic upgrade head"`
- [ ] Check database logs: `flyctl logs -a flowlog-db`
